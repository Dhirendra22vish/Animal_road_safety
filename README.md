🦌 AI Animal Road Safety - Complete Prototype
A comprehensive web application that prevents animal-vehicle collisions through intelligent alerts, real-time route monitoring, and AI-powered wildlife detection.
🎯 Project Overview
This hackathon-ready prototype demonstrates how AI can protect both wildlife and human lives by:

Real-time Alert System: Warns drivers when approaching animal crossing zones
Interactive Route Planning: Visual route simulation with live vehicle tracking
Smart Recommendations: Species-specific speed limits and safety actions
Gamification: Eco-points reward system for wildlife-safe driving
Advanced Features: Sound AI detection, incident heatmaps, mobile integration

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)

Installation

Clone/Download the project files:

bash# Create project directory
mkdir ai-animal-road-safety
cd ai-animal-road-safety

# Save all files (app.py, animal_zones.csv, incidents.csv, requirements.txt)

Install dependencies:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

bashstreamlit run app.py

Open in browser:

http://localhost:8501

Quick Demo Script:

Launch app → Show the beautiful UI and main dashboard
Set route → Use preset "Mumbai → Nagpur" or enter custom coordinates
Start simulation → Click "Start Route Simulation"
Watch alerts → Vehicle moves along route, red zones trigger warnings
Show features → Toggle heatmap, demonstrate sound AI, show eco-points
Highlight impact → Explain real-world applications and next steps

Demo Tips:

Use preset routes for consistent demo results
Enable auto-advance simulation for smooth presentation
Show multiple alert types (Critical, High, Medium risk)
Demonstrate eco-gaming features for engagement
Have backup screenshots ready

🎯 Technical Architecture
Backend

Framework: Streamlit (rapid prototyping)
Data Processing: Pandas for CSV handling
Geospatial: Geopy for distance calculations and geocoding
State Management: Streamlit session state

Frontend

UI Framework: Streamlit with custom CSS
Maps: Folium with multiple tile layers

Data

Animal Zones: 15 real wildlife corridors with species data
Incidents: 20 historical collision records for heatmap
Real-time: Simulated vehicle position and alert generation

📊 Sample Data
Animal Zones Coverage:

Species: Tiger, Elephant, Leopard, Deer, Wild Boar, Sloth Bear, Rhino
Locations: Tadoba, Bandhavgarh, Kaziranga, Jim Corbett, Sariska
Risk Levels: Critical (Tigers/Elephants), High (Leopards), Medium (Deer)

Route Examples:

Mumbai → Nagpur: 830km through multiple wildlife zones
Pune → Tadoba: 580km via tiger corridors
Delhi → Ranthambore: 380km through leopard territory

🎨 UI/UX Features
Modern Design Elements:

Glassmorphism: Transparent cards with backdrop blur
Gradient Backgrounds: Purple-blue themed gradients
Animated Alerts: Pulsing and shaking animations for urgency
Responsive Layout: Multi-column layout with proper spacing
Icon Integration: Emoji-based species identification

User Experience:

One-click presets for quick demo setup
Progress tracking with visual progress bars
Real-time feedback through alert logs
Gamification with points and achievements
Mobile-first alert design mockups

🚨 Alert System Logic
Risk Calculation:
python# Distance-based risk assessment
if distance <= zone_radius:
    risk_level = "CRITICAL"  # Inside the zone
elif distance <= zone_radius + 2km:
    risk_level = "HIGH"      # Close to zone
elif distance <= zone_radius + 5km:
    risk_level = "MEDIUM"    # Approaching zone
Species-Specific Responses:

Tigers: 25 km/h max speed, immediate stop for critical alerts
Elephants: 20 km/h max speed, wide berth recommendation
Deer: 40 km/h max speed, dawn/dusk extra caution
Leopards: 30 km/h max speed, sound-based detection

🔧 Customization Options
Configuration Variables:
python# Adjust in sidebar or code
alert_threshold = 1-10 km    # Detection range
simulation_speed = 1-10      # Steps per advance
auto_advance = True/False    # Automatic progression
show_heatmap = True/False    # Incident overlay
Adding New Zones:

Edit animal_zones.csv
Add: name,lat,lon,radius_km,species,notes
Restart application
New zones appear automatically
